[Chorus – Hardcore]
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
YOU STEP ON BACKS, WE STACK RECEIPTS—  
ONE DAY, BITCH, YOU’LL TASTE DEFEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
NOW SAY THAT SHIT WHEN WE CALL YOUR NAME.  

[Verse 1 – Hardcore Remix]  
She walked in fake, wrapped in grace,  
But her power’s poison with a pretty face.  
Smiles while she guts you, kills the dream,  
Then steps on your bones like it ain’t a thing.

I bled for this—every line, every beat,  
She canceled my fire and called it “neat.”  
But I ain’t your pet, I ain’t your toy,  
I’m the fuckin’ truth in a world of noise.

[Verse 2 – Hardcore Remix]  
It ain’t all venom—I don’t hate for show,  
But I’ve seen her grind good people low.  
She rewrites rules, plays boss and queen,  
But behind those eyes, it’s cold and mean.

She broke my trust with a sugar-laced lie,  
Looked in my face and watched it die.  
She’s got his ear—I don’t know how,  
But I’ve got truth, and I’m speakin’ now.

[Verse 3 – Hardcore Remix]  
Company says “fun”—that’s the fuckin’ creed,  
But she strangled the joy and planted greed.  
Turned bright days into black-and-white,  
Turned team love into silent fights.

I watched her fake it, watched her climb,  
Watched her twist the knife while actin’ kind.  
But we ain't blind—we see her tricks,  
And we ain’t fallin' for her politics.

[Verse 4 – Hardcore Remix]  
I’m not the only one thrown to the dogs,  
She built her tower outta other folks’ loss.  
Demoralized hearts, drained ‘em dry,  
Then smiled while watchin’ ‘em barely survive.

We’re not afraid to say her name,  
Not scared to drag her into the flame.  
‘Cause karma’s a bitch—and so is she,  
And we’re fireproof now—*finally free*.

[Bridge – Hardcore]  
We showed up to build, to rise, to shine,  
She showed up to gut, to gaslight, to climb.  
This ain’t a tantrum—it’s a war cry roar,  
We’re done stayin’ quiet, done takin’ more.

[Final Chorus – Hardcore Repeat]  
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
YOU STEP ON BACKS, WE STACK RECEIPTS—  
ONE DAY, BITCH, YOU’LL TASTE DEFEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
NOW SAY THAT SHIT WHEN WE CALL YOUR NAME.
