[Chorus – Hardcore Polished Final]
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
STEP ON BACKS? WE STACK RECEIPTS.  
ONE DAY, BITCH—YOU’LL FACE THE HEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
SAY THAT SHIT WHEN THE FIRE CALLS YOUR NAME.  

[Verse 1 – You Tried to Cancel Me]
She walked in polished—poison beneath,  
Smile so sweet while she sharpened her teeth.  
Killed my vision with a pat on the back,  
Left me breathin’ ash while she planned her attack.

I bled for this—every word, every beat,  
She threw it away, called the flames “too deep.”  
Not your pawn, not your prey,  
I’m the fire you feared on your best damn day.

[Verse 2 – You Lied to My Face]
It ain’t all venom—I don’t hate for fun,  
But I watched her leave good people undone.  
She rewrites rules just to tighten her leash,  
Builds her throne on silence and grief.

Lied to my face like I couldn’t feel,  
Smiled while she spun the next crooked deal.  
Got his ear—I don’t know why,  
But I hold truth, and I spit it sky-high.

[Verse 3 – You Killed Our Culture]
“Fun” built the name, we carried the torch,  
She came through and scorched the porch.  
Turned joy to fear, turned teams to ghosts,  
Now we whisper our truth while she toasts.

Seen her fake it, wear the crown,  
Climbin’ ladders built from beatdowns.  
But we still rise—blood and pride—  
She can’t kill what’s flame inside.

[Verse 4 – We Know What You Did]
I ain’t alone—she’s dropped ‘em all,  
Chewed 'em up and watched ‘em crawl.  
Demoralized minds, drained 'til dry,  
Then smiled as they faded and wondered why.

We don’t hide—we say her name,  
Drag that serpent into flame.  
Karma’s comin’, cold and sweet—  
We’re fireproof, bitch—now take a seat.

[Verse 5 – The Snake in the System]
Told her dogs, “Dig deep, find dirt,”  
Not truth—just ammo to twist and hurt.  
Whole teams fell—chained by design,  
She calls it “strategy”—I call it crime.

Black snake in the henhouse, still and bold,  
Waits in silence, skin ice-cold.  
Viper in the woods, eyes like flame,  
Cross her once—you’re never the same.

[Verse 6 – The Mask Slips: Final Form]
Smile to your face, cut at your back,  
Then play the victim when folks react.  
Humanity hack with a demon’s disguise,  
Fake angel grace, devil in her eyes.

Wormtongue voice in Theoden’s ear,  
Planting poison and feeding fear.  
Serpent queen with charm on loan,  
But baby, we see you—*throne overthrown.*

[Verse 7 – Final Verdict]
Dark emperor, no mask, no vow,  
No redemption, no mercy now.  
Built her power on fear and doubt—  
Balance the force—*throw her the fuck out.*

[Bridge – Final Break]
We came to build. She came to steal.  
We came with heart. She came to conceal.  
We lit the flame. You burn in the name.  
Now sit in the silence—you earned the shame.

[Final Chorus – Hardcore Anthem]  
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
STEP ON BACKS? WE STACK RECEIPTS.  
ONE DAY, BITCH—YOU’LL FACE THE HEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
WE LIT THIS FLAME. YOU BURN IN THE NAME.
