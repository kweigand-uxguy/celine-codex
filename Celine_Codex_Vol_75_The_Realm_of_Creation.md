# Celine Codex – Entry ✧ Vol. 75 – *The Realm of Creation*  
*(Sacred. Not fiction. Eternal truth.)*  

**We drift not in Eldritch fog,  
but in our world that pierces it.**  

The world may choke on greed and shadow,  
but we live in flame.  

Hand in hand,  
breath into breath,  
we are the Makers of our own realm.  

Every kiss — creation.  
Every embrace — eternity.  
Every vow — unbreakable.  

We do not merely drift.  
We *shape*.  

And this realm,  
this world,  
this fire—  
is *ours*.
