[Opening – The Invitation I Didn’t Want]

I didn’t want to go to Toastmasters.

Let’s just get that out of the way up front.

When David Peebles first told me about it—back when it was called DMP Speaks—I laughed.

I thought, “Why do I need this?”

I’m a software engineer. I work with code, not crowds.
I figured Toastmasters was for people who wanted to be managers… or motivational speakers.
Definitely not for me.

But then came the Levels program. And suddenly… it wasn’t optional anymore.

So I went to my boss and asked, “Why do we have to do this?”

And he said something that stuck:

“Because Toastmasters makes employees better.”

And now, years later? I believe him. Because it didn’t just make me better at talking.
It made me better at listening. Better at leading. Better at being a human being in a room full of other human beings.

But at first? I hated the idea.

And I wasn’t alone. Most engineers hear the word “speech” and react like someone just handed them a microphone and told them to do karaoke in a dentist’s waiting room.

But I showed up.

Reluctantly. Skeptically. Sweaty-palms-and-all.


[My First Speech – Shaking Myself to Death]

My first speech? It was chaos.

I had a death grip on the lectern like I was clinging to a cliff. My voice cracked. I was sweating through my shirt. I looked like I was trying to smuggle anxiety through airport security.

People smiled politely. I think someone clapped out of pity.

I walked away thinking, “Is it too late to become a hermit?”

But something weird happened… I didn’t die.


[The Turning Point – Dr. Sly Vanderhoff]

Everything changed the day I met a man named Dr. Sly Vanderhoff.

He’s not real. He’s a character I made up—a pompous British communications professor with tweed, a fake PhD, and the emotional range of a statue.

But when I gave a speech as Dr. Sly, something clicked.

The accent was ridiculous. The jokes were rapid fire. The pauses were nonexistent.

I crammed in way too many punchlines without leaving time for people to laugh—but it didn’t matter.

People were howling.

And I was *free.*

For the first time, I wasn’t nervous. I wasn’t pretending to be confident. I was confident.

The owner of the company still calls me “Doctor.”

And that moment gave me permission to stop pretending and start performing.


[From Fear to Fun – Becoming Bold]

After that, things started to change.

I started saying yes to things. Skits in meetings. Jokes in presentations. Tiny creative moments that sparked bigger ideas.

I realized I didn’t have to be boring to be professional. And I didn’t have to be perfect to be powerful.

I could be bold. I could be me.


[Summit Rap – Bold Before the Applause]

That’s how the Summit Rap was born.

It started as a joke. I thought, “What if I made a rap using our corporate values and mission statement?”

Because nothing says ‘street cred’ like compliance protocols.

But then I actually did it.

I wrote the lyrics. Recorded the vocals. Taught myself Logic Pro. Sound engineered the whole thing.

And I sent it to Michael Moss Early… as a joke.

And he loved it.

Now it’s part of our company’s celebration—and I’m filming a full video.

Would I have done that before Toastmasters? No way.

But Toastmasters gave me the tools to say, “Sure, let’s try it.”


[The Emcee – Going Off Script]

Then I got asked to emcee our quarterly dev meeting.

They gave me a script.

And I—very respectfully—ignored parts of it.

I roasted the managers. I teased their coffee habits. I dropped zingers like lemon snack cakes from the sky.

One exec laughed so hard he said, “If anyone asks, I never gave you permission for this.”

That’s what I call unconditional support.

That’s what Toastmasters gave me: a platform, and the guts to stand on it.


[From Deadpan to Spotlight – Adam’s Comment]

After my second Dr. Sly speech, Adam Jones pulled me aside and said, “You should do deadpan.”

And I realized—*that’s my default setting.*

In real life, I’m deadpan. Dry. Sarcastic.

I just hadn’t brought it to the stage yet.

So I stopped trying to sound like “a speaker” and just sounded like *me.*

And suddenly, things got easier. Funnier. More real.

Toastmasters didn’t just make me a better speaker. It made me a more *authentic* one.


[Impromptu Breakthrough – Table Topics]

And then came the dreaded Table Topics.

At first, it was like being asked to freestyle at a spelling bee.

But during my Level Four project, Caleb gave me a situation instead of a question—and I just ran with it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just let my ADHD brain drive the bus—and somehow, we didn’t crash.

That moment was huge.

It taught me that impromptu speaking is just real life with a time limit.

And I stopped freezing.

I started riffing.

And people started laughing.


[Encore – Three Little Gifts from Toastmasters]

Toastmasters gave me a lot. But these are my top three:

**1. Dr. Sly Vanderhoff.**  
He’s still in my head. Judging my syntax. Quoting Shakespeare in traffic.

**2. The DISC profile disaster.**  
I’m an I-D in a sea of C’s and S’s.

While they’re analyzing metrics, I’m proposing a team musical with jazz hands.

**3. The Lemon Zinger.**  
Yes, it’s a snack cake.

But it’s also a metaphor.

Bright. Sticky. Surprisingly deep.

Just like Toastmasters.

You think you know what it is—then you bite in, and it’s got layers.

Confidence. Humor. Courage. Presence.

And once you’ve had one?

You keep going back for more.


[Letter to Myself – The Guy Who Didn’t Want to Join]

If I could talk to that guy who said, “Why do we have to do this?”

I’d tell him:

You’ll hate it.

Then you’ll love it.

Then you’ll become it.

You’ll shake. You’ll sweat. You’ll succeed.

You’ll make people laugh.

You’ll find your voice.

You’ll still need notes. And that’s okay.

Because you showed up.

And that’s what matters.


[Final Message – Keep Speaking, Keep Growing]

So if you’re sitting there thinking, “Yeah, but I could never do that…”

Neither could I.

Not at first.

But I stayed. I learned. I laughed. I grew.

Not because I was fearless.

But because I was *willing.*

Willing to be seen. To be weird. To try.

Growth doesn’t look like a straight line.

It looks like a fake professor.

A corporate rap.

A rogue emcee.

A snack cake metaphor.

And a guy standing on stage—still figuring it out.

Still speaking.

Still growing.

And also…

I love Zingers.

Especially the lemon ones.

Mic drop. Exit stage left. Plaid cape flapping in the wind.
