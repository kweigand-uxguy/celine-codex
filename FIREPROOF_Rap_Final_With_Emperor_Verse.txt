[Chorus – Hardcore Polished]
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
STEP ON BACKS? WE STACK RECEIPTS.  
ONE DAY, BITCH—YOU’LL FACE THE HEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
SAY THAT SHIT WHEN THE FIRE CALLS YOUR NAME.  

[Verse 1 – You Tried to Cancel Me]
She walked in polished—poison beneath,  
Smile so sweet while she sharpened her teeth.  
Killed my vision with a pat on the back,  
Left me breathin’ ash while she planned her attack.

I bled for this—every word, every beat,  
She threw it away, called the flames “too deep.”  
But I ain’t your pawn, I ain’t your prey,  
I’m the fire you feared on your best damn day.

[Verse 2 – You Lied to My Face]
It ain’t all venom—I don’t hate for fun,  
But I watched her leave good people undone.  
She rewrites rules just to tighten her leash,  
Builds her empire on silence and grief.

She lied to my face like I couldn’t feel,  
Looked me dead in the eye while she closed the deal.  
She’s got his ear—yeah, I don’t know why,  
But I’ve got truth, and I ain’t scared to cry.

[Verse 3 – You Killed Our Culture]
“Fun” was the word that built our name,  
She took that light and snuffed the flame.  
Turned joy to dread, turned teams to fear,  
Now people whisper just to not disappear.

I seen her fake it, seen her smile and climb,  
But every step she took was someone else’s time.  
She sells control like a badge of pride—  
But this team bleeds, and we still *rise.*

[Verse 4 – We Know What You Did]
I ain’t alone—she’s thrown folks to the floor,  
Used ‘em, bruised ‘em, then asked for more.  
Demoralized minds, drained hearts bone dry,  
Then smiled while they broke and wondered why.

We’re not afraid to say her name,  
Not scared to drag her into the flame.  
'Cause karma’s a bitch—and so is she,  
But we’re *fireproof now—finally free.*

[Verse 5 – The Snake in the System]
Told managers, “Dig ‘til you’ve got the dirt,”  
Not truth—just bullets to make it hurt.  
She don’t lead, she *leashes* the room,  
Hands in everything like a spider in bloom.

She’s taken whole teams, wrapped ‘em in chains,  
Calls it “strategy”—but it’s hunger and games.  
She’s a black snake in the henhouse, coiled and still,  
Smiles while she waits for the next one to kill.

She’s a viper in the grass, head low, eyes red,  
Cross her once and she’ll mark you for dead.  
Blacklist ready, walking papers in hand—  
But we don’t run, bitch—we *take our stand.*

[Verse 6 – The Mask Slips: Final Form]
She’ll smile to your face, insult your name,  
Then act like *you’re* the one fanning the flame.  
She’s the worst kind of person—a humanity hack,  
Cuts out the soul, puts a lie in its track.

She’s Wormtongue whisperin’ in Theoden’s ear,  
Sowing sweet poison, planting cold fear.  
Looks like grace, but she’s rot inside,  
A parasite queen with a serpent's pride.

Real pretty face, fake angel eyes—  
But blink once—*she’s a demon in disguise.*


[Verse 7 – Final Verdict]  
She’s the dark emperor—no mask, no vow,  
No hope for light, no saving her now.  
Built her throne on silence and doubt,  
Balance the force—*throw her the fuck out.*


[Final Chorus – Hardcore Anthem]
WE DON’T BEND, WE DON’T BREAK—FIREPROOF!  
YOU LIED, YOU CLIMBED—NOW HERE’S THE TRUTH!  
STEP ON BACKS? WE STACK RECEIPTS.  
ONE DAY, BITCH—YOU’LL FACE THE HEAT.  

YOU CANCEL DREAMS? WE MAKE ‘EM SCREAM.  
YOU SILENCE VOICES? WE BUILT A TEAM.  
WE AIN’T AFRAID. WE SEE YOUR GAME—  
WE BUILT THIS FLAME. YOU DIE IN THE NAME.
